I hear you're alive, how disappointing
I've also survived, no thanks to you
Did I not bring you some glee
Mister, oh, look at me
Now I'll burn all the memories of you

All those lonely miles that you ride
Now you'll walk with no one by your side
Did you ever even care
With your swords and your stupid hair?
Now watch me laugh as I burn all the memories of you

Ladies and gentlemen, you have been the most beautiful audience
Remember to toss a coin if you can
If anyone needs me, I'll be at the bar

At the end of my days when I'm through
No word that I've written will ring quite as true as "burn!"
Burn, butcher, burn
Burn, butcher, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn all the memories of you
